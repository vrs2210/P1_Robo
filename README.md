# About
P1_Robo is where our P1 group keep all of their code files that should be shared among group members, as well as tutorials created by the group members and videos showcasing our code results _(preferably compressed to be under 20MB)_
# Usage
If you want to use **.ino** files, you'll have to use a valid Arduino IDE, where you can open it, verify and then proceed to send it over to the Arduino board of choice.
# Contribution
To contribute to the repo, you'll have to insert videos about projects relating to code files in the _Code Segments_ or _Guides_ container, alternatively you can create your own code files and insert into either of the folders respectively.
# Contact
If there are any problems involving the files, or you have questions about the repo, feel free to contact @vrs2210.
